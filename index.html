			<p>Hello, it's me!  My name is Michael Negron.  I am a graduate of Rowan University where I received a Bacholors Degree of History and a Minor in Law and Justice studies.  But that is not all!  I continued my education and received a certification from Rutgers University Coding Bootcamp.</p>
			<p>That is not all to the story!  Besides the general assestment from my educational history (studios, determined, hard-working), I've been described as a great team player, hard-working, and enthusiastic.  Personally, I'll like to add I have numerous leadership qualities and an excellent problem solver.  I welcome all challanges and look to do my very best to accomplis any task at hand!</p>
